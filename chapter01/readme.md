# Lesson 1 Assignment

## Invent an Imaginary Embedded System
Tell us about an embedded system that does not exist. It can be grandiose or strange; it can be something just one step beyond what you have around you. Ideally it is something you personally want to build (even if physics doesnâ€™t allow it). What is it? What does it do? What general components do you need?

This should be summarized in 3-6 sentences. A diagram would be nice but not required. Write your idea in a Google doc or a md file on Github and submit your assignment link to the #assignment-submission channel on Discord. Make sure your submission is publicly viewable.
